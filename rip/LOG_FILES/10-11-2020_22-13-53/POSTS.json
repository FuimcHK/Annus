However over the past few months I\u2019ve fallen behind watching every video that comes out so a few weeks ago I started catching up and I\u2019m happy to say that I have successfully done so. But watching these videos started making me think about something which is mentioned a lot have I been making the most of the time I have not in terms of watching the channel but in life after some thinking I\u2019ve came to the conclusion that I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been participating in my hobbies less and each day has felt more and more like I\u2019m going through the motions. I know I\u2019m sorry mark would be disappointed that I\u2019m not living up to my full potential. But the reason I\u2019m saying this is to remind everyone out there that sees this in the final days of Unus Annus that they need to make the most of their time because unlike Unus Annus you will never truly know how much time you have left. So live everyday to its fullest even on the hardest of days that is what this channel has taught me and I hope to put this knowledge into practice for the rest of my life. \nMemento Mori Unus Annus."

Now, with it being completely gone within the coming days, I was just wondering if it will be a huge part of \"YouTube history\" that I will be missing out on, as there definitely not much time to binge watch every single video. Kind of feel bad and a bit sad about not being part of it, but I am for whatever good it did for everyone, especially during these trying times. So yeah, what's the deal, and please share everything you want to on it :)"

Most likely the official subreddit will be deleted as well, so I want to use the few days we have left to promote this subreddit to remember Unus Annus - Memento Unus Annus.\n\nIf you feel sad to see Unus Annus go and need someone to talk, make a post and find people who feel the same way. If you want to share you favorite memes (pictures only) feel free to do so. You can make a post of everything thats related to Unus Annus and the connection we have to them.\n\n**However, this is not** supposed to be a place to share old videos or clips to trick the inevitability of death- this won't be allowed as we should all accept that what's dead will never come back. But this can be a place for those of us who feel lost and want to not only keep this community alive, but also make this one year Mark and Ethan have gifted us be remembered for many years to come.\n\nAs Thomas Campell once said:  *\u201cTo live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.\u201d*\n\n**Memento Mori, friends.**\n\n*PS: The subreddit will become Private as soon as the channel is deleted. People will still be able to join by requesting access and nobody will be denied - however to keep this community tight and to not have it become a meme factory which attracts random people who don't really know what this is about, I think it's the right step to make it less accessible and only to be found by original fans!*\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MementoUnusAnnus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MementoUnusAnnus/)"

Every morning I would wake up with her sleeping outside my door and I would get the best puppy kisses and loves for the first 5 mins of my day when I would see her. (My parents didn't let her sleep in my room). I would then get ready and go to school. I went about my day and then would come home and the first thing I would hear is my dogs excitement and a \"ROOO ROOOOOOO\" from her. Then I would go up stairs and set my stuff down as fast as I could so I could hug her and get kisses. She always kissed my nose and only my nose. Fast forward to the summer before my second year of college. I was so excited to be on my own but I knew I would miss Minnie so much. I came and visited every weekend (which was a 3 hour trip to and 3 hours back). I had an alright 2nd year of college but then decided to transfer to a new college. In that summer I decided to just come home and spend time with Minnie because she was 12 and I knew she was getting old. It was June 3rd when I decided to take her to the vet because she had still been acting weird. I had mentioned to my mom and step dad that they should take her to the vet... but something was definitely wrong. So it was just me who took her and they got a blood draw and came back with the news... Her kidneys were failing. Which I had heard dogs could come back from and that it wasn't necessarily a death certificate, but... this time... she was in stage 5 kidney failure. I had asked the front desk while I was waiting when the lise time my dog had been in to see the vet and it was last December when I had taken her. The doctor had had my dog as one of her first patients and was crying when she told me the news. We tried to give her a diet just in case there was some miracle, but nothing helped. So 6 days after my birthday... we decided in order to put her out of her misery we needed to put her down. I was heart broken. We wrapped her up in her favorite blanket and went in. I held her as tight as I could and the doctor who was sobbing asked if I was ready \"my mom said yes\" I told her that I loved her so much. She gave me one last kiss on the nose and then she was limp. I screamed in pain my heart hurt more than it had ever hurt before. I couldn't control myself I was screaming and crying. As we were walking out someone's dog ran up to me to comfort me and the lady said \"you need to be quiet there are other people here\". I was screaming but the only thing I could utter was \"fuck you\" as the front desk lady told her that I had just put my dog down. I couldn't stand up. My heart was in so much pain. My mom lifted me and brought me to her car. I couldn't see. I couldn't breathe. I got home and went downstairs. I was so angry and sad. I blamed my parents because this was all preventable had they just taken her into the vet when I said and not lied to me and told me they did. I was cuddling her stuffed animal. My mom took some note cards and got nose prints and paw prints from her. That  night I was just sobbing in pain. I slept on the couch in the living room in the basement because I couldn't sleep in my room knowing I wasn't going to wake up to my morning cuddles and kisses. Animals strangely kept coming up to the window. I think they knew I was in pain. I laid on the couch for a month I could not move on my own. My step dad fed me and carried me to the bathroom. I had to go to school though because it was coming up and I needed an apartment. I left for school. The first week I was on my own again I slept on my couch and had a dream. I dreamt that the doctor came back with Minnie and had said she revived her and wanted me to take her back. That she wasn't really dead. And my dog in my dream ran around my back yard once again. I woke up in so much pain again. The dream was too real not to be true.... this was in 2016 and every once in a while I still dream about Minnie I dream about everything I could have done better for her. I dream about how I could have saved her. Exactly a year after I got the bad news I went to a shelter to spend time with animals because my heart was broken. I found one little kitten that was just infatuated with me. She screamed every time I left the shelter. I couldn't visit the dogs because of what had happened with Minnie. But I always visited the cats. This fluffy little kitten though with a whit striped nose and brown stripes on her nose that almost looked like suspenders holding up her cute tan nose, would scream if I wasn't with her. Thats when I new I had to take her home with me. Its been 3 years since then and I still have garnet. I took her for her routine check up at 1 year and they noticed something... they sent her in for a heart ultrasound... she was born with cardiomyopathy... meaning she might only live to age 4 at the most. She's doing well now but she is in stage 1 heart failure. I was never a cat person until I met her. She also has a silly brother named jasper who I also met at a shelter after I found out garnet was in heart failure. I knew she needed a playmate for when I had to work and so if she passed she wouldn't be alone."

I didn't start watching then, but I thought \"I will in a couple of days, it's whatever.\". \nFour days later, twenty days ago, twenty six days until the end, I started watching Unus Annus. And, by starting from the very fisrt video, I realized I had less then a month to watch more then 300 hundred videos. I made a playlist with every single video in chronological order, and I watched away. \nAnd today, I'm proud to say, I have officialy catched up. Having discovered it less then one month to the end, I will be here to watch it now, having watch every single one of these memories. \nMemento Mori, my friends. \nWe'll se eachother tomorrow. Hopefully."

But then to the end of the video there is the other side, i get sad and i know the end won't be as meaningful to me as it'd be without saving I know they wish only for the memories to remain, but i don't know if i'll be able to let go... I don't want to save them, i want to accept the fate, but i don't think i will be able to resist... how can I let go?"

Having something to rely on to just \\*be there\\*, to give you an opportunity to just check out and enjoy something and have a laugh (or cry). It's such a great gift to be able to give. I've followed Mark and Ethan for several years, and even though I never met them, I feel like we're friends.\n\n As a person that has Thanantophobia (fear of death), it's also opened the door to looking at things in a different light. I contemplated things throughout the drawing, and had to put it down quite a few times, but I felt the need to finish. I'm distraught it's over, and it's so surreal to me to grieve something intangible, but so very happy I got to witness it.\n\nSappy crap TL;DR,  \nThank you Mark and Ethan, Unus and Annus. It's been a wild ride.\n\nMemento Mori, Memento Vivere"

        "CONTENT": "For many of us, Unus Annus has become more than just a project of two guys on Youtube.\n\nIt has become a community and a place for like minded people who share the same humor, interests and ideology of Mark and Ethan.\n\n[I have created a new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MementoUnusAnnus/) and hope it to become a place for the community to stay after the death of the channel and the deletion of all videos. Most likely the official subreddit will be deleted as well, so I want to use the few days we have left to promote this subreddit to remember Unus Annus - Memento Unus Annus.\n\nIf you feel sad to see Unus Annus go and need someone to talk, make a post and find people who feel the same way. If you want to share you favorite memes (pictures only) feel free to do so. You can make a post of everything thats related to Unus Annus and the connection we have to them.\n\n**However, this is not** supposed to be a place to share old videos or clips to trick the inevitability of death- this won't be allowed as we should all accept that what's dead will never come back. But this can be a place for those of us who feel lost and want to not only keep this community alive, but also make this one year Mark and Ethan have gifted us be remembered for many years to come.\n\nAs Thomas Campell once said:  *\u201cTo live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.\u201d*\n\n**Memento Mori, friends.**\n\n*PS: The subreddit will become Private as soon as the channel is deleted. People will still be able to join by requesting access and nobody will be denied - however to keep this community tight and to not have it become a meme factory which attracts random people who don't really know what this is about, I think it's the right step to make it less accessible and only to be found by original fans!*\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/MementoUnusAnnus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MementoUnusAnnus/)"

It needs work, but here it is:\n\n\nMade with a barricade, cool to the touch.\n Filled with a substance, unable to be clutched.\n One side, with a substance buildup,\n The other, the other signaling that time's almost up.\n Even when the story closes it's covers,\n Bandits break in to flip it over.\nWhat is it?"

Ex: IHasCupquake and her husband Mario).\nMark stated a long time ago that he was uncomfortable about people shipping him with Sean (Jacksepticeye). And we all know what happened with that ship.\n\nPlease respect other\u2019s privacy and feelings. You may think of it as a joke, writing nsfw of them, drawing them as a couple, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just crossing someone\u2019s boundaries and that\u2019s not okay. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the rant, but it\u2019s come to my attention that not many people speak out about this. You may think Mark and Ethan won\u2019t see stuff like that, but they probably do, and they probably get as uncomfortable as I do. \n\nIn conclusion,\n\n\nRESPECT. OTHER\u2019S. BOUNDARIES. AND. FEELINGS.\n\nThank you for reading."

        "CONTENT": "As the end of the channel draws nearer with every passing day, I've started to reflect on what happened in my own life since the channel started, and I thought I'd share my short story and maybe some others will want to share theirs. At the beginning of this channel, I was a completely different person to be honest, I was partway through junior year of high school, didn't care about anybody else's problems whatsoever, and life seemed great as it was. Then quarantine hit, my first big stressor of the last year, as I am in a vulnerable group and so are most of my family members. Over quarantine I had a moment of self-reflection, and decided that I didn't want to be the person I was anymore. I started eating better, working out (at home obviously), and started emotionally maturing into someone who actually cared about others. Then, during mid-July I met someone who I really cared about. Her and I talked for about 3 months, her support and the channel helped me get through my second and third stressors of the last year, being my grandma's passing and having to either move out or get evicted (this was my first time ever moving). Then the final stressor hit during the last week or so of October. I went through my first true heartbreak with someone I loved. And again, the channel was there (along with my friends) to help me through it.\n\nTL;DR\n\n Just as Mark and Ethan made many memories and had many new experiences in the last year, I noticed that I did the same as well, some good, some bad, but all memories I'm glad I made nonetheless. And looking back, I think I've made the most of the past year. Thank you, Mark and Ethan, for all the memories of these videos in the last year\n\nMemento mori, sed noli oblivisci vivo.\n\nRemember death, but do not forget to live."

A radical plan to spend one year doing whatever they wanted, making jokes, taking risks, and attempting to go even further beyond. It was a morbid thought, to create something only to end it after a year of life but that is the nature of the world. It\u2019s a dark place where death is always approaching. No human on this planet ever knows when they will die, in what form it will come in, the shape it will take.\n\nDeath is an entity that strikes fear into all those who possess knowledge of it. Humans think about the clock winding down and fear the end. They live in sheltered bubbles, determined to stay alive even at the cost of living. People will refuse to take risks, scared of the inevitability of death claiming them \u201ctoo soon\u201d as they say. But death will come when it does and there is nothing stopping it. So why squander the most precious resource, time? Why bog yourself down with fear and a million scenarios of what if?\n\nHumans fear the unknown and death is perhaps the greatest unknown. More so than deep space or the bottom of the terrifying ocean. More than the number of creates that have lived and will live. Death is an unpredictable thing.\n\nThat is why one must embrace that it is natural. Accept that one day they will not be here. They must free themselves from the fear of the end by embracing today. Truly seize the day, in whatever way big and small. No longer putting off things one wishes to do or see. Allowing yourself to step away from the safety of routine and live in whatever way you want. Try something risky. Make a new friend. Put yourself out there. Showcase your talents, heedless of the hecklers. This is the only life you have and you must remember death. Remember it will end and that is not something to fear.\n\nCreating memories and feeling life in your veins is the answer. Accepting that you will not see eternity but knowing that you have this moment. This speck of time is promised, is guaranteed as you read this. As you set down the electronic and go do something to make yourself proud, make yourself feel alive. As you take this moment and attempt to go further beyond, whatever that may mean to you.\n\nMemento mori my friends, I hope to see you all again."

And I'm not ready.\n\nI'm gonna miss the channel, the community, the memes, everything. I thought of buying some merch as a memory but I realised that I'm broke af. My memory is really shitty and I forget stuff really easily and it's making me anxious knowing that after a few years I'm gonna forget everything. I didn't get to watch every episode since I have a lot to study and knowing that I have only 2-3 days left I gave up since I know that it's just gonna make me tear up. The problem with me is that I get easily attached to things and Unus Annus was one of them.\n\nThis channel helped me through hard times, never failing to make me laugh. And now here I am, trying not to cry. I know it sounds silly, but it's not my fault. Mark and Ethan made the best channel together and knowing it's gonna be gone, even forgotten and never discover by others, it's really hitting me hard.\n\nAnd now here I am, writing this instead of studying for tomorrow's test.\n\n This subreddit it's gonna be deleted and I won't be seeing any you any more and I just wanna say that your posts always made my day. Thank you.\n\nAnd if y'all got any tips on how to get through this I would really appreciate them."

As time went on and I got into the last 100 days of videos I did something I regret. I started archiving, thinking that I would enjoy looking back on the old memories. As more  videos started being released with a much more serious tone, I realized that I was missing the point of Unus Annus, it's meant to represent that everything is temporary. That no matter how hard you try you can't go back. Whether you're trying to fix mistakes or just live good moments again, you can't go back. The best thing you can do is live up to your full potential in the time you have left. Not look back on what you could have done differently but focus on making the best of what's ahead. This channel has made me realize I've been living life the wrong way. I sincerely thank Mark and Ethan for what they've done. \n\nIn case anyone's wondering I deleted everything I archived."

        "CONTENT": "Hi all. This is my first post here and will be quite a long one but have to share with the community. I've been a big fan of Mark for years now he's been such a huge inspiration and help to me. I think it was my Amazing Brother who introduced him to me and My Awesome Sister began to watch him too. I haven't always watched as much of his content as I maybe should but always loved him. He came into our life's on the years that followed My Beautiful Mother passing away in January 2012. It wasn't immediately after started watching him but during the darkest times ever for me over the years that followed he was a true light in my life. My Sis has watched him even more consistently than me and is a huge fan too. \n\nI didn't know as much about Ethan as hadn't seen much of Mark's content with his friends in the past. Me and My Sis did see Mark along with him at the You're Welcome tour though which was a truly amazing night. Getting to know Ethan has been awesome. I love him so much and he is now another true inspiration. Both Mark and Ethan have honestly saved my life. Seeing the combination of humour, bravery and emotional stuff on the channel has made it the best one ever in YouTube history.\n\nNow I feel really bad because know I can't watch all of the content on the channel in time. I have always been a big procrastinator and tend to just breeze myself into hating my past self often for decisions like this. What hits really hard this time is with some really bad events and missed opportunities in life I had the excuse to say I didn't realise that was going to happen at that point. This time I've known about the clock and channel deletion for ages but still didn't  watch all Mark and Ethans awesome content :( I put some videos off and chose other people and things to watch so many times and feel so guilty now. I feel like I've completely gone against what the channel stands for. I don't want others to feel bad too but for me personally I feel very regretful.\n\nI thank Mark, Ethan, Amy, Momiplier, etc so much for this channel and for giving us something so important in the history of the world. I love them so much and will try and learn the most important lesson from them. Memento Mori!"

I do have a bank card but apparently it doesn't work for online payment because it's like a \"light\" version lol. Google Pay won't work either because it would be over paypal too. \nI asked around in the community who suggested to get Prepaid credit cards but after going to some grocery stores and gas stations; turns out they don't sell them in my country. \nSooo now I'm so close to giving up but I'm gonna be so sad if I can't get one... \n\nDoes anybody have experience with that or suggestions?"

(ignore the politics refrences  in the song though) and then unus snaps at the end of the song and shoots annus, and has his way with the channel. \n\nalso another link i made, was the very last song, at the very end when the chorus is repeating 'who lives who dies who tells your story' imagine unus and annus slowly walking into the middle of the stage, nodding at the audience and walking to the back of the stage into the darkness. at the end when they disappear, the stage goes black and 'memento mori' projects on the screen \n\n\nthanks for listening to my ted talk"

I hope you like it.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt had been a dark night, darker than Ethan\u2019s suit. The two of them were standing on the top of a small cliff, looking up at the starry sky. They both knew what was coming. The end. The channel would be deleted in five days. Both Unus and Annus had known about this since they started, but it was only now that the reality of the situation sank in.\n\nMark and Ethan had done a lot over the past year, ranging from cooking with sex toys to doing god\u2019s fitness test. They truly had done so much, documenting it all for millions of people to watch and enjoy. They didn\u2019t expect it to be so popular, but they didn\u2019t mind it either. They liked that they were able to create such a wonderful community.\n\nThe sun finally set behind the hills, and the stars began to twinkle. \u201cHey, Mark?\u201d Ethan asked, looking at his friend. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to us when the channel dies?\u201d Mark sighed and looked up at the starry sky. \u201cI have no idea, to be honest\u201d he replied. \u201cI see\u201d Ethan muttered, sniffing. He could feel a lump forming in his throat. \u201cBut I like to look at it this way\u201d mark began, pointing at the sky. \u201cSome of those stars are probably long gone. They died, but we can still see them twinkling, and we remember them.\u201d Ethan smiled. \u201cSo when it\u2019s our time to go, people will remember us?\u201d mark nodded and put his arm around Ethan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAs long as people remember us for who we were, Unus Annus will survive.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, tears began to stream down Ethan\u2019s face. He buried his face into mark\u2019s chest, sobbing and wailing. Mark patted his friends back, comforting him. \u201cI don\u2019t want the channel to go\u201d he wailed, sobbing and sniffing. \u201cHey, it\u2019ll all be ok\u201d mark replied. Ethan lifted his head up. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s still sad. I mean, we\u2019ve done so much, come so far, made so many friends, and to see it all go\u2026\u201d Ethan stopped, wiped his eyes and sniffed. \u201cI know. But that\u2019s how it goes. We were told to make the most of our one year, and we did.\u201d mark explained, smiling. He was trying to hide how he was truly feeling because he knew that if he cried, Ethan would cry too. \u201cThanks, mark\u201d Ethan said, hugging his friend again. \u201cMaybe we should go. There are still more videos to make before the clock runs out.\u201d Mark nodded, and they headed back to finish off their video schedule."

My grandpa's had heart problems all his life, and it's gotten to the point where there's nothing the doctors can do. He's been is hospice care for a little while now, but we know he hasn't got much time left. Unus Annus has not only helped me try to accept this, but it's taught me that I have to make the most of the days we have left together. I want to thank the community for respecting the nature of Unus Annus and selling the message that time is precious because it's finite. I want to thank Amy, Evan, and all the editors for helping to produce such fantastic videos every single day. Lastly, I want to thank Mark and Ethan for making us laugh, cry, and hope, whether it be through doing something stupid in Mark's backyard, going out and learning a skill, or being in completely different houses searching the web for interesting things. I know it doesn't mean as much as awesome fanart or something, but I really want to say thank you to all of you. Memento Mori. Unus Annus."

To keep things as short as possible my grandfather was a very central figure to my life, as someone on the ASD spectrum (Autism Spectrum Disorder) I\u2019ve been socially stunted for all my life. My biggest problem has always been communicating with other people. Quite often I find myself unable to understand the meaning of what someone is trying to tell me even though I understand all the words individually (the same can also be true for people trying to understand me). My grandfather was the only person I\u2019ve ever known who I could communicate with and he would understand 100% of the time.\n\nEarlier this year he passed away suddenly and without warning, dying from a heart attack. My mind is still so jumbled up from that day that I couldn\u2019t even tell you the date let alone day of the week that it happened. I remember after being distraught for about 15 minutes after I found out I felt completely numb for what would have been at least another month and a half. Because of covid and my high functioning ASD I wasn\u2019t able to do therapy effectively at all (my household just doesn\u2019t have the resources for it).\n\nEventually I moved on with life as things happen, and I stumbled across Unus Annus again. I was about three months behind and as I raced to catch up before the channel would come to an end I began to realise that just like the channel we all have a very limited amount of time, and most of us are not fortunate enough to know when it will end. \n\nMy grandfather and I enjoyed our frequent conversations about the limitless cosmos, philosophy and the nature of society, and while the humour may not necessarily be to his taste I think he would definitely have liked the concept behind the channel (had I ever got to tell him about it). My grandfather above all else valued the pursuit of joy in life, which for him was with his family. He worked an incredibly boring (to me) desk job for his entire life where he was perceived simply as a recluse. When in reality it couldn\u2019t have been further from the truth.\n\nI could go on and on reminiscing about the crazy antics he would get up to with us but to stick to the topic, arguably his favourite thing was the sort of novelty one gets out of coincidences (hence why I\u2019m posting this). You see my grandfather was born on a Friday the 13th, November the 13th, to think that the final days of Unus Annus would align weekend of my grandfather\u2019s birth is something I think he would have gotten a kick out of were he still here (Any  closer to the date and I think I would\u2019ve believed that there was some sort of meaning to it).\n\nTo wrap up this post is just like to mention that the things we cherish can be taken away from us in an instant. I still lay awake at night haunted by the last words I ever said to him \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d. Which of course, I never did. \nSo I would like to speak my rendition of the \nUnus Annus motto:\n\nMemento Mori, forveant vitam\nWhich if I\u2019m not mistaken means: \nRemember Death, Cherish Life\n\nThanks for reading I guess\nUnus Annus"

I started getting into Unus Annus during its last month which I was thankful for because I got to catch up on everything I missed. The whole idea of Unus Annus is just so crazy and I love it so much and I got so attached to something I knew was going to be going away. But I didn\u2019t noticed how attached I was until the final two weeks. I feel like I took the whole month I was here for granted and I hate myself for it. I wish I would\u2019ve embraced ever single moment of every single video but I didn\u2019t I just watched it had a few laughs and moved on. But now I realize it\u2019s going to be so much harder to say goodbye when it\u2019s time. As I\u2019m writing this there is only 3 days 23 hours 16 minutes and 40 seconds. I\u2019m not ready for the final livestream. I don\u2019t think a lot of us are. But it\u2019s going to happen no matter how hard we beg and plead. I\u2019m trying to accept that fact but it\u2019s just so heartbreaking. I just want to enjoy the last few videos we have left until it\u2019s gone. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk. Memento Mori."

A few weeks after Unus Annus started my brother attempted suicide and I struggled to see the brighter side of things. My home life deteriorated and my work ethic became practically non existent. I stopped going to college and thought I had no reason to keep going. Then on the days I spent laying in bed I started watching this channel and the idea of death being inevitable and that we only get one shot hit close to home. I have slowly but surely worked my way back up. I now attend college every day and have found my motivation once again. I have dicided to put my effort into making a youtube channel as its something I've always wanted to do. If it wasn't for Unus Annus I would probably still be lying in bed everyday waisting the precious time I have left. Thank You Mark and Ethan. Thank you so much"

I\u2019ve been in denial that it\u2019s actually going away but it\u2019s just coming back to punch me in the face now. I\u2019ve always had a hard time letting go of things, ever since I was a child. Just the idea that one day after the channel dies, the channel will die from my memory as well. That only digs the deeper whole of all the things you forget in life, and the true inevitability of death, how one day everything ends no matter how long you try to hold on. It\u2019s never been easy for me to let go, and I don\u2019t think it ever will be. I feel so empty without it, and it\u2019s not even gone yet. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll watch to fill my time, will any content ever truly entertain me again? One single edit with sad music and the clock ticking over it sent me into a 2-hour long breakdown that I can\u2019t drag myself out of. The stream will destroy me. I can only compare this experience to one thing, my last year of summer camp. I can never get that back, I can never be young again and feel all those feelings again. I can ever go back there because I\u2019m too old for it now, because I ran out of time. I was inconsolable for days, my mother tried everything, all I could do was lay on the couch and sob. And that\u2019s all I can do now, at 6:05 am on a Tuesday before school laying on my side in my pitch black room crying my eyes out over a fucking YouTube channel. Why can\u2019t I just let go, remember the good, the bad, and the ugly and let it go? It\u2019s never been easy for me to move on, and I think in the end it\u2019s my own futile attempts to prolong things that make them more painful. I started worrying subconsciously at day 17, now it\u2019s day 3 and I\u2019m in full desperate begging mode. I don\u2019t know anyone or talk to anyone else who watches the channel, so the biggest fear is loosing the memories in my own head, having no one to talk to them about and eventually forgetting. I wish I did, wish I tried to make more friends in the fanbase while I still could. I\u2019m just hoping, that maybe some years down the line I\u2019ll be wearing my unus annus hoodie and someone will recognize it, and I\u2019ll have someone to talk to. \nI wish you all the best, memento mori everyone <3"

Things about stopping the clock and all that.\n\nSo i have a theory about what might happen during the live stream on the 13th. What if during the live stream, when Mark and Ethan are about to delete the channel, whoever was trying to stop the clock succeeds and the live stream ends. The channel doesn\u2019t get deleted, but there will be no new uploads because the clock is no longer ticking.\n\nIk it sounds stupid and honestly i doubt this. But it is interesting to think about. I personally hope the channel does get deleted because if it doesn\u2019t, then the whole lesson Unus Annus was trying to tell about how we have limited time will be a waste. On the other hand if it doesn\u2019t get deleted, we can relive the amazing memories that we all have witnessed for the past year."

I want to thank Mark and Ethan and I think that this is the right moment to do it. \n\nI've been dealing with depression and anxiety for many years now. I almost never felt happy, everything was stressing me out, I couldn't sleep, I had panic attacks every day and the thing that helped me the most was watching Markiplier's videos. I've been watching him since around 2014. His videos were the only thing that could make me laugh even if I was in the middle of a mental breakdown. \n\nThanks to Mark i found out about Ethan's channel. There's this one video on his channel. It's called \"Please Keep Fighting | Don't Take This Risk\". When Ethan stopped playing the game and started talking.... I cried. I started crying and couldn't stop. I felt like he was talking to me. I felt like finally there was somebody who cares about me. Then I decided that I'm gonna keep fighting and I'm not gonna give up.\n\nLike a half year later Unus Annus was created. I didn't care about the time we have left, I didn't care about the clock at the end of every video. It seemed like we have so much time. Everyday I had something to wait for. I'd watch newest Unus Annus video and forget about everything bad in the world. I'd just live the moment, be happy because I'm here to see this, I'm here to be a part of it. Now.... when there's only few days left I finally realized that nothing lasts forever. The channel will be gone just like everything else in this world. And even though I still can't fully accept the truth I want to thank you for doing this. I want to thank you all. Not only Mark and Ethan but also everyone in the fanbase. I feel like I'm part of something big and that makes me happy. \n\nI'm gonna keep fighting and I'll never forget how much you guys helped me. \nMemento Mori\nUnus Annus"

Saying goodbye is hard but it's just another stage of grief that all of us as humans must go through to be able to grow. \n\nIn early April, I attempted to take my own life and was almost successful. To be honest with you, I'm only alive right now due to pure luck. Thankfully it wasn't painful for very long, only for less than a second before I passed out in the ER. Just to explain how fatal the situation was without getting into too many details, my heart rate went from 75BPM to 180BPM in a matter of four seconds before I went unconscious. \n\nAfter I woke up from the two day coma, my life turned upside down, ***twice***. \n\nI was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for quite a while, had to have this huge talk with my family and had to be monitored. Ya know, the things that happens after you try to escape reality for good, at least to SoCal standards. And one of the things I had to do was come up with a routine for every day of the week.\n\nI'll  be totally honest with you, I didn't want to do anything at all. I wanted to cave in again and never see the outside. The thought of rehabilitation just seemed so fucking impossible to me. I considered myself to be a walking corpse already.\n\nIt was like that for a really long time. The I saw it. \"Wikifeet: A tale of Two Tootsies\". Somehow in a that short amount of time, I forgot about Unus Annus. I don't even know how thats possible due to the fact that I witnessed you two cook with sex toys.\n\nI started catching up to date, It took me hours but I did it in less than a day. Then finally, I had to wait for the next day for the next upload. I hadn't notice it at first but that was it, that was my first routine for my rehabilitation. Watch a new video of two grown adults doing god knows what. I soon began to get back on track with a positive attitude to life. \n\nThroughout this end of the year, I had to think hard about the things I could have missed out if I did end up dying in the hospital on April. I would have missed the rest of the sweet content that Unus Annus had to offer, but most importantly, I could have missed out on my *life*. I almost missed out graduating high school, or turning 18. I almost missed out on protesting for human rights, I almost  missed out voting for my country. I almost missed birthdays and celebrations or continuing to make my mom smile. Almost missed out on waking up to my dog licking my face every morning to go out and play. \n\nI'm only here for who knows how long, but I learned that everyday is a gift. It's still hard getting out of bed everyday, but every time I do get a sense of achievement, a small voice in my head saying \"*you made it!*\" I've gotten so far and I'm not getting ready to stop any time soon.\n\nThe channel is coming to an end, and ,maybe Mark and Ethan won't be able to read this soon, or ever, but I want to thank them so much for doing what they do. It's been a huge help to my recovery, and I'm so happy I could witness this entire journey. I wish it didn't have to end, but all things must come to an end when its time. \n\nIf ya'll could upvote this so it can have a higher chance for Mark and Eef to read, I'd really appreciate it!\n\nThank you guys so much.\n\nMemento Mori \n\nUnus Annus\n\n&#x200B;\n\nps. heres a photo of me with cake on my face celebrating turning 18 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0zyanrd3hdy51.jpg?width=1047&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1aaa712198760aa36f729500ff59530b1c5f2fa5"
