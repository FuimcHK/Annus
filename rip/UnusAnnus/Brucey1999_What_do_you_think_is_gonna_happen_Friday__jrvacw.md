I don’t mean the actual content of the livestream but the actual logistics. I’m just wondering how it will actually work. Can you delete a channel while live-streaming from it? If so what happens? Does YouTube just implode?

I’ve wondered if maybe they will end the live stream and then delete the channel or finish the stream then leave it up for a certain amount of time (like maybe an hour) to give more people the chance to see it (people with exams and other unavoidable commitments etc). 

But rewatching the Accepting the Truth video, Annus says that it will be deleted live. 

I’m lucky I’m able to actually watch it live, but I’m terrified of my internet crashing (as it does often) part way and missing parts of the stream (and I can’t go anywhere with more reliable internet as we’re in another Lockdown here in the UK) 

I just want to know what’s gonna happen (also how long do we reckon the stream will last)
