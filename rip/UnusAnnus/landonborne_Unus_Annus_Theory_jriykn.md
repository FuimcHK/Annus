Ok so most of us know about the secret messages that’s been snuck into Unus Annus videos. Things about stopping the clock and all that.

So i have a theory about what might happen during the live stream on the 13th. What if during the live stream, when Mark and Ethan are about to delete the channel, whoever was trying to stop the clock succeeds and the live stream ends. The channel doesn’t get deleted, but there will be no new uploads because the clock is no longer ticking.

Ik it sounds stupid and honestly i doubt this. But it is interesting to think about. I personally hope the channel does get deleted because if it doesn’t, then the whole lesson Unus Annus was trying to tell about how we have limited time will be a waste. On the other hand if it doesn’t get deleted, we can relive the amazing memories that we all have witnessed for the past year.
