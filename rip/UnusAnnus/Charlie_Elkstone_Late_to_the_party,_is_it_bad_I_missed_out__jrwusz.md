## [Late_to_the_party,_is_it_bad_I_missed_out_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrwusz/late_to_the_party_is_it_bad_i_missed_out/)
So I will keep this short and say that a couple months back I noticed a tweet or some post mentioning Markiplier and Ethan doing this one year YouTube channel, and I meant to get on it, but with things in life, I never found the time to delve in and watch it. Now, with it being completely gone within the coming days, I was just wondering if it will be a huge part of "YouTube history" that I will be missing out on, as there definitely not much time to binge watch every single video. Kind of feel bad and a bit sad about not being part of it, but I am for whatever good it did for everyone, especially during these trying times. So yeah, what's the deal, and please share everything you want to on it :)
