Hey wonderful people! I’ve been loving the Sanctuary guardian meme edits that editors put in the videos. And I think I’ve tracked down all of them but ONE

Here are the ones I found:

https://youtu.be/5PB8S9slhd4 3:08 (two e’s)
https://youtu.be/-0-YVCXwt30 5:07 (the ball one)
https://youtu.be/dyrwhe5BV_8 9:01 (mark is gone)
https://youtu.be/yfro5jkDiLE 5:10 (two travis scott’s)

Now, I vividly remember there being one more of these, where Ethan was baffled by something, and there was the edit of his face that was switched by a dog lying on its side with the caption “how?”

I have been combing through the videos for a couple of days and I can’t find it. ITS MAKING ME GO INSANE. Was there one like that or am I delusional?
