Its safe to say that this year has been terrible, not just for me but for millions of people around the world. A few weeks after Unus Annus started my brother attempted suicide and I struggled to see the brighter side of things. My home life deteriorated and my work ethic became practically non existent. I stopped going to college and thought I had no reason to keep going. Then on the days I spent laying in bed I started watching this channel and the idea of death being inevitable and that we only get one shot hit close to home. I have slowly but surely worked my way back up. I now attend college every day and have found my motivation once again. I have dicided to put my effort into making a youtube channel as its something I've always wanted to do. If it wasn't for Unus Annus I would probably still be lying in bed everyday waisting the precious time I have left. Thank You Mark and Ethan. Thank you so much
