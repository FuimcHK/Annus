Unus Annus

1 year in latin

Memento Mori 

How could this happen?




So quick

Has it been a year?

So soon 

The clock ticks ever near




To the day of the closing

To the day of the end

To the day of the sorrow

And to the day of the grand




Where they delete the channel

And every video left

Gone with only memories

No evidence it was kept




You don't need to be scared

You control your own mind

Death is inevitable 

Peace in it you must find




For time stops for no one

The clock ticks ever on

Until the clock reaches zero

And the two are gone




But what if the timer stops?

What if Unus and Annus live on?

What if the lore was true?

What if it's all wrong?




What if we are thinking too much into it?

What if we are proving their point ?

That we are unaccepting of death

What have we joined?




A cult some argue

Just a channel others say

But it holds a special place in my heart

And with that I'd like to say




Thank you for a great year

Thank you for the motivation

Thank you for making us laugh

Thank you for the inspiration




We all appreciate everything 

Thank you for sharing this channel with us
