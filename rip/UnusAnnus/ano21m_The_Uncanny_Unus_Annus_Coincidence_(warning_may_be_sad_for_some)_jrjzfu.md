I’ve been watching Unus Annus from day one and loving every moment of it. To keep things as short as possible my grandfather was a very central figure to my life, as someone on the ASD spectrum (Autism Spectrum Disorder) I’ve been socially stunted for all my life. My biggest problem has always been communicating with other people. Quite often I find myself unable to understand the meaning of what someone is trying to tell me even though I understand all the words individually (the same can also be true for people trying to understand me). My grandfather was the only person I’ve ever known who I could communicate with and he would understand 100% of the time.

Earlier this year he passed away suddenly and without warning, dying from a heart attack. My mind is still so jumbled up from that day that I couldn’t even tell you the date let alone day of the week that it happened. I remember after being distraught for about 15 minutes after I found out I felt completely numb for what would have been at least another month and a half. Because of covid and my high functioning ASD I wasn’t able to do therapy effectively at all (my household just doesn’t have the resources for it).

Eventually I moved on with life as things happen, and I stumbled across Unus Annus again. I was about three months behind and as I raced to catch up before the channel would come to an end I began to realise that just like the channel we all have a very limited amount of time, and most of us are not fortunate enough to know when it will end. 

My grandfather and I enjoyed our frequent conversations about the limitless cosmos, philosophy and the nature of society, and while the humour may not necessarily be to his taste I think he would definitely have liked the concept behind the channel (had I ever got to tell him about it). My grandfather above all else valued the pursuit of joy in life, which for him was with his family. He worked an incredibly boring (to me) desk job for his entire life where he was perceived simply as a recluse. When in reality it couldn’t have been further from the truth.

I could go on and on reminiscing about the crazy antics he would get up to with us but to stick to the topic, arguably his favourite thing was the sort of novelty one gets out of coincidences (hence why I’m posting this). You see my grandfather was born on a Friday the 13th, November the 13th, to think that the final days of Unus Annus would align weekend of my grandfather’s birth is something I think he would have gotten a kick out of were he still here (Any  closer to the date and I think I would’ve believed that there was some sort of meaning to it).

To wrap up this post is just like to mention that the things we cherish can be taken away from us in an instant. I still lay awake at night haunted by the last words I ever said to him “I’ll see you tomorrow!”. Which of course, I never did. 
So I would like to speak my rendition of the 
Unus Annus motto:

Memento Mori, forveant vitam
Which if I’m not mistaken means: 
Remember Death, Cherish Life

Thanks for reading I guess
Unus Annus
