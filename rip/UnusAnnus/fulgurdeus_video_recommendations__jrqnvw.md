## [video_recommendations_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrqnvw/video_recommendations/)
so I was following unus annus around the beginning, stopped, restarted half way through, stopped again and now here we are, at the end of the road with the destination in sight.

I would like to receive video recommendations from you guys since I practically missed about 2/3 of the channel.

thanks a lot.

Memento mori.

Unus annus.
