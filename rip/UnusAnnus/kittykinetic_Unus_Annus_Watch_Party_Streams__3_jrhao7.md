Hey guys!  
I always see people doing youtube watch party videos on Twitch and honestly, I loved watching Unus Annus but it's different when you get to enjoy it with someone else with you. The pandemic has made a lot of us stuck just solo-enjoying things which kinda just sucks.  
So until the channel is taken down this week, I'm going to be streaming Unus Annus at random times with my dogs if anyone wants to just chill and watch it with us! I think it'll be nice to enjoy this temporary memory together.

^(\*\*side note: I believe my Twitch is age restricted to 18+, sorry (it's because I smoke weed because I live in Washington where it's legalllll and honestly, watching Unus Annus a second time while high has been 2x as funny im soRRY KIDS))
