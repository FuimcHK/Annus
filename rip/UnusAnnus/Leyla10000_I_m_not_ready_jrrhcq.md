## [I_m_not_ready](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrrhcq/im_not_ready/)
Just like the title says, I'm not ready for the endind. I thought I was, it didn't bother me really much. But now the reality really hit me. And I'm not ready.

I'm gonna miss the channel, the community, the memes, everything. I thought of buying some merch as a memory but I realised that I'm broke af. My memory is really shitty and I forget stuff really easily and it's making me anxious knowing that after a few years I'm gonna forget everything. I didn't get to watch every episode since I have a lot to study and knowing that I have only 2-3 days left I gave up since I know that it's just gonna make me tear up. The problem with me is that I get easily attached to things and Unus Annus was one of them.

This channel helped me through hard times, never failing to make me laugh. And now here I am, trying not to cry. I know it sounds silly, but it's not my fault. Mark and Ethan made the best channel together and knowing it's gonna be gone, even forgotten and never discover by others, it's really hitting me hard.

And now here I am, writing this instead of studying for tomorrow's test.

 This subreddit it's gonna be deleted and I won't be seeing any you any more and I just wanna say that your posts always made my day. Thank you.

And if y'all got any tips on how to get through this I would really appreciate them.
