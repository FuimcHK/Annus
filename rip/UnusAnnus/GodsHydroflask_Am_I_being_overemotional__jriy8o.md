## [Am_I_being_overemotional_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jriy8o/am_i_being_overemotional/)
As much as I hate to say it, it is just a YouTube channel, I shouldn’t spend hours ugly crying in bed that it’s ending. I pride myself on not being emotional, but I always have been very sentimental, and unus annus doesn’t leave much to hold onto. 
I have no idea how I could ever fill my time without it again, some small naive part of me is still in denial that they’re actually going to delete the channel, but it know it’s coming. I just can’t handle it.
