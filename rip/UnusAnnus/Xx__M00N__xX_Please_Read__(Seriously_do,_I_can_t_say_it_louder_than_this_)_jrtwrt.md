Okay, to set things straight, I get people can do what the want, but sometimes there’s a line you cannot cross.

I was scrolling through Wattpad and I found an Unus Annus fanfiction. Lo and behold, it had nsfw between Mark and Ethan. I didn’t read it because I was just disgusted and uncomfortable.

For the love of God and everything else, DO NOT SHIP REAL PEOPLE TOGETHER (unless they are already a couple. Ex: IHasCupquake and her husband Mario).
Mark stated a long time ago that he was uncomfortable about people shipping him with Sean (Jacksepticeye). And we all know what happened with that ship.

Please respect other’s privacy and feelings. You may think of it as a joke, writing nsfw of them, drawing them as a couple, but it’s not. It’s just crossing someone’s boundaries and that’s not okay. 

I’m sorry for the rant, but it’s come to my attention that not many people speak out about this. You may think Mark and Ethan won’t see stuff like that, but they probably do, and they probably get as uncomfortable as I do. 

In conclusion,


RESPECT. OTHER’S. BOUNDARIES. AND. FEELINGS.

Thank you for reading.
