hello fellow unus annus fans as we are all aware unus annus is coming to an end, and yes it is heartbreaking and some of us may not be ready but fear not i have a plan. now mark and ethan have recently banned the dance of italy BUT once the channel is deleted then there will be no proof that the ban ever existed. so here me out let's say for the final day we all get together and record ourselves doing the dance of Italy now we can cosplay as unus annus or just be ourselves or better yet throw your own little spin in there animate it, paint it do whatever. this little project is something i thought of to show mark and ethan (a.k.a unus annus) how amazing of it year it has been and how many they have touched. memento mori well see you tomorrow...unus annus
