Unus Annus: One Year with the sole goal of teaching a community about memento mori; remembering death. A radical plan to spend one year doing whatever they wanted, making jokes, taking risks, and attempting to go even further beyond. It was a morbid thought, to create something only to end it after a year of life but that is the nature of the world. It’s a dark place where death is always approaching. No human on this planet ever knows when they will die, in what form it will come in, the shape it will take.

Death is an entity that strikes fear into all those who possess knowledge of it. Humans think about the clock winding down and fear the end. They live in sheltered bubbles, determined to stay alive even at the cost of living. People will refuse to take risks, scared of the inevitability of death claiming them “too soon” as they say. But death will come when it does and there is nothing stopping it. So why squander the most precious resource, time? Why bog yourself down with fear and a million scenarios of what if?

Humans fear the unknown and death is perhaps the greatest unknown. More so than deep space or the bottom of the terrifying ocean. More than the number of creates that have lived and will live. Death is an unpredictable thing.

That is why one must embrace that it is natural. Accept that one day they will not be here. They must free themselves from the fear of the end by embracing today. Truly seize the day, in whatever way big and small. No longer putting off things one wishes to do or see. Allowing yourself to step away from the safety of routine and live in whatever way you want. Try something risky. Make a new friend. Put yourself out there. Showcase your talents, heedless of the hecklers. This is the only life you have and you must remember death. Remember it will end and that is not something to fear.

Creating memories and feeling life in your veins is the answer. Accepting that you will not see eternity but knowing that you have this moment. This speck of time is promised, is guaranteed as you read this. As you set down the electronic and go do something to make yourself proud, make yourself feel alive. As you take this moment and attempt to go further beyond, whatever that may mean to you.

Memento mori my friends, I hope to see you all again.
