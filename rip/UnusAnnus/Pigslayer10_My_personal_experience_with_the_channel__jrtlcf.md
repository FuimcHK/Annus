## [My_personal_experience_with_the_channel_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrtlcf/my_personal_experience_with_the_channel/)
As the end of the channel draws nearer with every passing day, I've started to reflect on what happened in my own life since the channel started, and I thought I'd share my short story and maybe some others will want to share theirs. At the beginning of this channel, I was a completely different person to be honest, I was partway through junior year of high school, didn't care about anybody else's problems whatsoever, and life seemed great as it was. Then quarantine hit, my first big stressor of the last year, as I am in a vulnerable group and so are most of my family members. Over quarantine I had a moment of self-reflection, and decided that I didn't want to be the person I was anymore. I started eating better, working out (at home obviously), and started emotionally maturing into someone who actually cared about others. Then, during mid-July I met someone who I really cared about. Her and I talked for about 3 months, her support and the channel helped me get through my second and third stressors of the last year, being my grandma's passing and having to either move out or get evicted (this was my first time ever moving). Then the final stressor hit during the last week or so of October. I went through my first true heartbreak with someone I loved. And again, the channel was there (along with my friends) to help me through it.

TL;DR

 Just as Mark and Ethan made many memories and had many new experiences in the last year, I noticed that I did the same as well, some good, some bad, but all memories I'm glad I made nonetheless. And looking back, I think I've made the most of the past year. Thank you, Mark and Ethan, for all the memories of these videos in the last year

Memento mori, sed noli oblivisci vivo.

Remember death, but do not forget to live.
