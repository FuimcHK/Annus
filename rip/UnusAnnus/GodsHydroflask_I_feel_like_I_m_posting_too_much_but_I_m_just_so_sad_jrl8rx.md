I’m so crushed that unus annus is going away, that this subreddit will be gone. That one day even the people that have bought the merch and  have really learned a life lesson from this channel will begin to forget it. It’s terrifying to think about, that when I’m old I either won’t remember or won’t care, and I dread that. 
So much of me wants to believe that they won’t actually delete the channel, but I know that they will and to give myself or anyone else that hope is cruel. I’ve got nothing to fill my time with and no reason to get up every day without it, I’ll have the memories, but for how long? memento mori, unus annus
