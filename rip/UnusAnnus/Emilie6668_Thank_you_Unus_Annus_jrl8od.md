With only 3 days left, I thought that this would be a good time to say this. I just really want to say thank you for everything. Unus Annus has helped so much throughout the year, keeping my mental health stable. I can't even begin to describe how much the channel and the community means to me. If it wasn't for this community, I would have probably died. I'm incredibly sad to see Unus Annus so close to death, but I will always have the memories. Thank you so, so much for everything you people did, it helped so much.
Memento mori.
Unus Annus.
