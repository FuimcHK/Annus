## [Since_Unus_Annus_is_ending,_I_wanted_to_shine_a_light_on_a_somewhat_similar,_criminally_underrated_channel_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrwaas/since_unus_annus_is_ending_i_wanted_to_shine_a/)
A few years back I started watching a channel by the name of The Modern Rogue. It's made up of two dudes who try to do stupid shit and to try and teach you how to do things that may come in handy in a very specific set of circumstances, as well as just trying to become cooler. I think it's very similar to Unus Annus because both are made up of two guys doing dumb shit, but this one will be around even after Unus Annus ends. Hope you check them out, they're really funny, and you might even learn a thing or two!
