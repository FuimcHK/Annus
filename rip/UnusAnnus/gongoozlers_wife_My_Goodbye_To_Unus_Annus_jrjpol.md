## [My_Goodbye_To_Unus_Annus](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrjpol/my_goodbye_to_unus_annus/)
Ok this shits gonna be real cheesy and yeah. So, I basically just wanna say thank you to the Unus Annus community and the channel. I started getting into Unus Annus during its last month which I was thankful for because I got to catch up on everything I missed. The whole idea of Unus Annus is just so crazy and I love it so much and I got so attached to something I knew was going to be going away. But I didn’t noticed how attached I was until the final two weeks. I feel like I took the whole month I was here for granted and I hate myself for it. I wish I would’ve embraced ever single moment of every single video but I didn’t I just watched it had a few laughs and moved on. But now I realize it’s going to be so much harder to say goodbye when it’s time. As I’m writing this there is only 3 days 23 hours 16 minutes and 40 seconds. I’m not ready for the final livestream. I don’t think a lot of us are. But it’s going to happen no matter how hard we beg and plead. I’m trying to accept that fact but it’s just so heartbreaking. I just want to enjoy the last few videos we have left until it’s gone. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk. Memento Mori.
