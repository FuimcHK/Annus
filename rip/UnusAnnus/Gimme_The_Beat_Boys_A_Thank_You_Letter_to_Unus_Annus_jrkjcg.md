## [A_Thank_You_Letter_to_Unus_Annus](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrkjcg/a_thank_you_letter_to_unus_annus/)
I cannot succinctly describe my experience with Unus Annus. It's been a part of my life for almost a year now, and it's had such a deeper meaning than I ever thought it would. My grandpa's had heart problems all his life, and it's gotten to the point where there's nothing the doctors can do. He's been is hospice care for a little while now, but we know he hasn't got much time left. Unus Annus has not only helped me try to accept this, but it's taught me that I have to make the most of the days we have left together. I want to thank the community for respecting the nature of Unus Annus and selling the message that time is precious because it's finite. I want to thank Amy, Evan, and all the editors for helping to produce such fantastic videos every single day. Lastly, I want to thank Mark and Ethan for making us laugh, cry, and hope, whether it be through doing something stupid in Mark's backyard, going out and learning a skill, or being in completely different houses searching the web for interesting things. I know it doesn't mean as much as awesome fanart or something, but I really want to say thank you to all of you. Memento Mori. Unus Annus.
