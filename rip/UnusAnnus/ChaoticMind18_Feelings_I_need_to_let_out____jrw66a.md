## [Feelings_I_need_to_let_out___](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrw66a/feelings_i_need_to_let_out/)
I'm not crying about Unus Annus ending (yet). However, it is slightly overwhelming me. I'm having trouble working on school things while the end is in mind. It feels like everything is going to die actually. Then, all will revive again. All except Unus Annus. It feels like we are going to wake up the next morning and Unus Annus will have been nothing but a long crazy dream. Until we see the merch around our rooms or the fanart in our sketchbooks. To everyone else, it will be just a normal day. To us...

Well in other words...BOY SATURDAY MORNING IS GONNA FEEL FUCKED AS FUCK.
