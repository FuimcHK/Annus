## [Just_bought_merch_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrpjbp/just_bought_merch/)
Did I just spend almost 200$ on Unus Annus merch? Yes. Do I feel good about it? I think so but I definitely will when I'll receive it, and until then I'll have my bank account to remind me that I have no money and no merch.

 Thanks for watchin'
Smash like and subscribe for probably nothing else coming from me since this is my first post on the Unus Annus reddit and probably my last.
