Sorry, I probably sound like an entilted brat but my parents wont get money on ther cards befor the timer runs out, and with me being 16 I dont have money. But with every second I feel my hope crumble. I WAS PART IN HISTORY but wont have the proof. I am not the only one going trough this but has anyone advice on how I stop feeling this hopless?

Sorry for bad grammar, I dont live in an english speaking country.
