## [Am_I_allowed_to_download_the_episodes,_if_I_delete_them_immediately_after_watching_them_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrryj0/am_i_allowed_to_download_the_episodes_if_i_delete/)
For context: Over the last month, I've been trying to binge watch almost the Entirety of Unus Annus (365 videos) in 30 days and unfortunately, I failed. I am at the 245th video of Unus Annus and there is no way in hell I'll be able to watch 120 videos in just 4 days while also having school. The question is in the title. Don't worry, I won't reupload any of them and after watching them, I'll delete them immediately. I'll also like every single video. So, am I allowed to? I'll do it anyway, but i'd like the blessing of the community for it.
