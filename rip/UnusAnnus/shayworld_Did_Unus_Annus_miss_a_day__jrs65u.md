I am going through all the videos and writing them down to keep a catalog of all the videos names.

I am currently at the beginning of April, but I realised something odd.

The video “Ultimate Youtuber Boxinbg Showdown” was on the 30th of March, while “Where in the world is Unus Annus?” Was in the 1st of April. Did they miss March 31st, or am I missing something?

Momento Mori

Edit: I just found out it got claimed. It was the Omeagle video. Does anyone know the name of the video?

Edit 2: The video was called “The Deep End of Omegle: Risky Boogaloo”
