For those that don't know  Children in Need is a charity that collects money for Kids in the UK. Every year there is a big event with people doing challenges and celebs getting involved, and this year it is on Friday AKA the day Unus Annus ends. I'd like to raise the suggestion of letting mark and Ethan know about this , in case they want to get involved.
