I jumped on the train for unus annus as soon as it launched and I loved it, it brought me so much laughter and made me look forward to the end of the day. About 150 days in I had a real low in my life and didn’t want to do anything and stopped watching, I never picked it back up because for some reason something was holding me back because I didn’t watch it for so long during my hard time. Now that the channel is ending I’m genuinely sad I missed the opportunity to enjoy all of it and will miss it
