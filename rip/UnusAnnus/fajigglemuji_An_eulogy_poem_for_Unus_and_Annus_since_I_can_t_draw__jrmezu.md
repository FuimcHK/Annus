Life is but a sputtering flame,/
And as the breathing wind/
Ripples the water,/
It also spreads thin/
The glow beheld/
By the watching./
For we all knew/
The end/
Was approaching,/
And yet,/
Laughs/
Kept the shiver/
From the spine,/
As convinced/
We were/
That plenty of time we had/
Before the crushing loss./
Alas, of time indeed/
We have run dry/
And soon/
The tears falling/
Will fade away once/
The funeral is streamed live./
Taunting are now those words/
Even lying still upon a page,/
“Memento mori”;/
For how could I ever let slip/
The meaning?/
I’m lost in my head/
Staring at the ceiling/
Wondering/
If I’ll someday forget,/
But the show must go on./
One must not dwell/
And lay wishing./
Regret is what matters/
In the end,/
And inspirations/
Are uniquely our own,/
So live a life inspired,/
Create your own story,/
But most of all:/
Memento vivere,/
Memento mori.

Me and a friend of mine are going to make a poetry account where we post original poetry for a year on it and after the year is over we will delete everything. I have a feeling this idea of a year to create and delete will find many different outlets. I doubt this will make it to mark and ethans eyes but i really have enjoyed this year and i am just thankful that i was able to see such a wonderful project unfold. 

Memento mori

I won't see you tomorrow (come Friday ;-;)
