## [Has_anyone_got_there_refund_from_the_Unus_Annus_MERCH_site_crash_on_11_3_2020_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrwb7x/has_anyone_got_there_refund_from_the_unus_annus/)
I bought almost $100 worth of Unus Annus merch on 11/3. And it charged my account 3 times. I filled out the old form for a refund for the extra charges on the 4th, then refilled out their new form the other day when they sent out the mass email. I then sent them and email today for an update, and I still haven’t heard anything back from them. I really don’t like to complain because shit happens. But I have to pay bills and missing $200 for over a week now is fucking ridiculous. 
Just wondering if anyone has actually received their refund???
