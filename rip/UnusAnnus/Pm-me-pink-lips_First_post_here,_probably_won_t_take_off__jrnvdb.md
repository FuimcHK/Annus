I've been watching from the beginning. Originally I wasn't taking it very seriously, just thought it was gonna be some funny videos deleted at the end of the year. As time went on and I got into the last 100 days of videos I did something I regret. I started archiving, thinking that I would enjoy looking back on the old memories. As more  videos started being released with a much more serious tone, I realized that I was missing the point of Unus Annus, it's meant to represent that everything is temporary. That no matter how hard you try you can't go back. Whether you're trying to fix mistakes or just live good moments again, you can't go back. The best thing you can do is live up to your full potential in the time you have left. Not look back on what you could have done differently but focus on making the best of what's ahead. This channel has made me realize I've been living life the wrong way. I sincerely thank Mark and Ethan for what they've done. 

In case anyone's wondering I deleted everything I archived.
