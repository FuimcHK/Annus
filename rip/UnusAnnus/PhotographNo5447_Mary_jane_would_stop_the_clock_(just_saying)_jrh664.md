**I'm mainly saying this as a joke**, but like would it be a great opportunity/idea for them to **"chill"** for a bit, considering they did buy a weed candle and YouTube didn't care, so... I think its fine if they did **"chill"** also the idea of a happier Ethan is not fathomable.

please upvote so it is possible for them to see this in time (or not, up to u)
