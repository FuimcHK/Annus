## [Is_the_music_used_in_the__Let_s_Get_Cooking__transition_royalty-free_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrijvx/is_the_music_used_in_the_lets_get_cooking/)
As asked in the title. I wish to use the music from let's get cooking (and friends) in a transition of my own as a subtle nod to Unus Annus. Does anyone know where I could get the music? Would it be against Mark and Eef's wishes as it was once a part of the channel and the community culture as a whole?

Thanks for any info anyone can provide!
