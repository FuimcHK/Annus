## [Paying_on_youtooz](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrm4ua/paying_on_youtooz/)
Sooo the past few days I've been *desperately* trying to somehow buy the Unus Annus youtooz hourglass figure before it's sold out, but I just can't find a way to pay it. 
They don't accept paypal (why???) and I don't have a credit card. I do have a bank card but apparently it doesn't work for online payment because it's like a "light" version lol. Google Pay won't work either because it would be over paypal too. 
I asked around in the community who suggested to get Prepaid credit cards but after going to some grocery stores and gas stations; turns out they don't sell them in my country. 
Sooo now I'm so close to giving up but I'm gonna be so sad if I can't get one... 

Does anybody have experience with that or suggestions?
