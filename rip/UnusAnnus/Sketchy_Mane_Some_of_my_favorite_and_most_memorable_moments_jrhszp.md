One of my favorite times in Unus Annus was the paintball gun saga. That paintball shot looming over Ethan until that fateful video.  


My other favorite videos were the chinese archery one, the axe throwing, the valentine's one followed by drunk college, the fight choreography, the miming, the ghost hunting, and the escape room.  
I also liked the ominous videos like Mark's basement, discussing the idea of killing each other as a joke, the escape room, and the phasmophobia.  


And the video where the reenacted all their videos I literally could not stop laughing.  


So yeah I just felt like listing off all the videos that first come to mind whenever I reflect on the channel.
