## [Memento_Unus_Annus_-_A_subreddit_to_remember_the_good_old_days_for_those_of_you_who_need_some_company_after_Unus_A](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jruq8r/memento_unus_annus_a_subreddit_to_remember_the/)
For many of us, Unus Annus has become more than just a project of two guys on Youtube.

It has become a community and a place for like minded people who share the same humor, interests and ideology of Mark and Ethan.

[I have created a new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MementoUnusAnnus/) and hope it to become a place for the community to stay after the death of the channel and the deletion of all videos. Most likely the official subreddit will be deleted as well, so I want to use the few days we have left to promote this subreddit to remember Unus Annus - Memento Unus Annus.

If you feel sad to see Unus Annus go and need someone to talk, make a post and find people who feel the same way. If you want to share you favorite memes (pictures only) feel free to do so. You can make a post of everything thats related to Unus Annus and the connection we have to them.

**However, this is not** supposed to be a place to share old videos or clips to trick the inevitability of death- this won't be allowed as we should all accept that what's dead will never come back. But this can be a place for those of us who feel lost and want to not only keep this community alive, but also make this one year Mark and Ethan have gifted us be remembered for many years to come.

As Thomas Campell once said:  *“To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die.”*

**Memento Mori, friends.**

*PS: The subreddit will become Private as soon as the channel is deleted. People will still be able to join by requesting access and nobody will be denied - however to keep this community tight and to not have it become a meme factory which attracts random people who don't really know what this is about, I think it's the right step to make it less accessible and only to be found by original fans!*
