Sorry if this is a little short. I hope you like it.

It had been a dark night, darker than Ethan’s suit. The two of them were standing on the top of a small cliff, looking up at the starry sky. They both knew what was coming. The end. The channel would be deleted in five days. Both Unus and Annus had known about this since they started, but it was only now that the reality of the situation sank in.

Mark and Ethan had done a lot over the past year, ranging from cooking with sex toys to doing god’s fitness test. They truly had done so much, documenting it all for millions of people to watch and enjoy. They didn’t expect it to be so popular, but they didn’t mind it either. They liked that they were able to create such a wonderful community.

The sun finally set behind the hills, and the stars began to twinkle. “Hey, Mark?” Ethan asked, looking at his friend. “What’s going to happen to us when the channel dies?” Mark sighed and looked up at the starry sky. “I have no idea, to be honest” he replied. “I see” Ethan muttered, sniffing. He could feel a lump forming in his throat. “But I like to look at it this way” mark began, pointing at the sky. “Some of those stars are probably long gone. They died, but we can still see them twinkling, and we remember them.” Ethan smiled. “So when it’s our time to go, people will remember us?” mark nodded and put his arm around Ethan’s shoulder. “As long as people remember us for who we were, Unus Annus will survive.”

Suddenly, tears began to stream down Ethan’s face. He buried his face into mark’s chest, sobbing and wailing. Mark patted his friends back, comforting him. “I don’t want the channel to go” he wailed, sobbing and sniffing. “Hey, it’ll all be ok” mark replied. Ethan lifted his head up. “I know, but it’s still sad. I mean, we’ve done so much, come so far, made so many friends, and to see it all go…” Ethan stopped, wiped his eyes and sniffed. “I know. But that’s how it goes. We were told to make the most of our one year, and we did.” mark explained, smiling. He was trying to hide how he was truly feeling because he knew that if he cried, Ethan would cry too. “Thanks, mark” Ethan said, hugging his friend again. “Maybe we should go. There are still more videos to make before the clock runs out.” Mark nodded, and they headed back to finish off their video schedule.
