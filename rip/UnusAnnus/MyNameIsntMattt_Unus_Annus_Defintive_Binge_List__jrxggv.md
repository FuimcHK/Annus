## [Unus_Annus_Defintive_Binge_List_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrxggv/unus_annus_defintive_binge_list/)
With only days left until the channel ends, it's looking pretty bad for anyone who just now hops on Unus Annus. So, I have a challenge, if you had to shrink the channel into 30 definitive videos which help give a general gist of what the channel was, what video would you choose and why? What 30 videos to create the definitive binge watch list?
