There's thus riddle that I really like that I found on a book a couple of years ago. It was in a Dragonology book. It goes like this:

In marble walls as white as milk,
Lined with skin as soft as silk.
Within a fountain crystal clear, 
A golden apple does appear.
No doors are there to this stronghold,
Yet theives break im to steal the gold.


It was a really cool riddle, so i put an Unus Annus spin on it >:). It needs work, but here it is:


Made with a barricade, cool to the touch.
 Filled with a substance, unable to be clutched.
 One side, with a substance buildup,
 The other, the other signaling that time's almost up.
 Even when the story closes it's covers,
 Bandits break in to flip it over.
What is it?
