[Unus and Annus, out of time.](https://preview.redd.it/kqv7khe3lhy51.png?width=2027&format=png&auto=webp&s=0360f5b8352f661a4e0d7ecd6fcfc56211c4adc5)

 I've been debating whether or not to post this, but I ultimately decided to share.

 Unus Annus has been such a huge thing for me, and it's helped me through a lot of 2020. Having something to rely on to just \*be there\*, to give you an opportunity to just check out and enjoy something and have a laugh (or cry). It's such a great gift to be able to give. I've followed Mark and Ethan for several years, and even though I never met them, I feel like we're friends.

 As a person that has Thanantophobia (fear of death), it's also opened the door to looking at things in a different light. I contemplated things throughout the drawing, and had to put it down quite a few times, but I felt the need to finish. I'm distraught it's over, and it's so surreal to me to grieve something intangible, but so very happy I got to witness it.

Sappy crap TL;DR,  
Thank you Mark and Ethan, Unus and Annus. It's been a wild ride.
