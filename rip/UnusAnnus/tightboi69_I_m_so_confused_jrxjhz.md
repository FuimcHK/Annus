Will mark and ethan going to die, if they see this in the livestream then some of us need a full explanation, when unus anus goes will they themselves die with it, it just makes me feel sad that they would die even though they have been with us for so long, mark has been in my life throughout 6 years and I'd hate to see him go, and Ethan is too innocent to die. So if I were to ask them I would ask "are you guys really going to die? Like actually dying dying and not saying you are but not gonna." If they die then their deaths can cause huge problems along with alot of fans being hurt by their deaths.
