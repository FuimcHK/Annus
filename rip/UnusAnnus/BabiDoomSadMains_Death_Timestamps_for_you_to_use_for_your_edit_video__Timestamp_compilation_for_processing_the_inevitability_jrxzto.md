Never did I expect to become so attached to this channel and invested.  Its as like going  along their adventure & experiences with them. Most of all, their Momento Mori has helped me manage frequent existential crisees, and the fear of death, how this fear is not unique and how its ok to talk about instead of hush hush. They might have helped you too in this way.  So for a momento mori video (or if you just want to make a dramatic edit)  or if you just want to process deaths inevitability, here is a compilation of many of their momento mori moments.  \[Its long, unlike our temporary lives. ;)   \]
