## [How_should_I_wash_my_founders_hoodie_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrqwmu/how_should_i_wash_my_founders_hoodie/)
I dont want any of the logos or texts to wash off because Iâ€™ve heard that happen, I was thinking of washing the hoodie of cold, and gentle spin, with it turned inside out, but how should I dry it? And while washing it, should I use a tide pod (Thats the only laundry soap I have)? Advise is greatly appreciated!
