I wasn't sure if I should write this, but I wanted to see if this message could get to Mark and Ethan to show them how thankful I am to both of them. Saying goodbye is hard but it's just another stage of grief that all of us as humans must go through to be able to grow. 

In early April, I attempted to take my own life and was almost successful. To be honest with you, I'm only alive right now due to pure luck. Thankfully it wasn't painful for very long, only for less than a second before I passed out in the ER. Just to explain how fatal the situation was without getting into too many details, my heart rate went from 75BPM to 180BPM in a matter of four seconds before I went unconscious. 

After I woke up from the two day coma, my life turned upside down, ***twice***. 

I was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for quite a while, had to have this huge talk with my family and had to be monitored. Ya know, the things that happens after you try to escape reality for good, at least to SoCal standards. And one of the things I had to do was come up with a routine for every day of the week.

I'll  be totally honest with you, I didn't want to do anything at all. I wanted to cave in again and never see the outside. The thought of rehabilitation just seemed so fucking impossible to me. I considered myself to be a walking corpse already.

It was like that for a really long time. The I saw it. "Wikifeet: A tale of Two Tootsies". Somehow in a that short amount of time, I forgot about Unus Annus. I don't even know how thats possible due to the fact that I witnessed you two cook with sex toys.

I started catching up to date, It took me hours but I did it in less than a day. Then finally, I had to wait for the next day for the next upload. I hadn't notice it at first but that was it, that was my first routine for my rehabilitation. Watch a new video of two grown adults doing god knows what. I soon began to get back on track with a positive attitude to life. 

Throughout this end of the year, I had to think hard about the things I could have missed out if I did end up dying in the hospital on April. I would have missed the rest of the sweet content that Unus Annus had to offer, but most importantly, I could have missed out on my *life*. I almost missed out graduating high school, or turning 18. I almost missed out on protesting for human rights, I almost  missed out voting for my country. I almost missed birthdays and celebrations or continuing to make my mom smile. Almost missed out on waking up to my dog licking my face every morning to go out and play. 

I'm only here for who knows how long, but I learned that everyday is a gift. It's still hard getting out of bed everyday, but every time I do get a sense of achievement, a small voice in my head saying "*you made it!*" I've gotten so far and I'm not getting ready to stop any time soon.

The channel is coming to an end, and ,maybe Mark and Ethan won't be able to read this soon, or ever, but I want to thank them so much for doing what they do. It's been a huge help to my recovery, and I'm so happy I could witness this entire journey. I wish it didn't have to end, but all things must come to an end when its time. 

If ya'll could upvote this so it can have a higher chance for Mark and Eef to read, I'd really appreciate it!

Thank you guys so much.
