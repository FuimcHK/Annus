so when i made the order i tried to pay and it said card declined every time. now me being dumb i didn't check my bank account and i accidentally bought some merch multiple times. i want to cancel one of them but i haven't got like an email or anything with the order number and stuff. It's been roughly like 12 hours. does it come eventually or have i messed up badly?
