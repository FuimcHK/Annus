Here is a lovely gravestone artwork for this soon to be gone yet forever legendary channel. I'm...not sure if it looks that much like a gravestone. But I am happy with how it turned out.

Am thinking of adding a sort of poem to this post later but just need more inspiration first. For now, what do my fellow Unus Annus followers think?
