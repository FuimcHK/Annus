Heres an idea ive been thinking of: Unus Annus is ending. theres little to no chance they wont delete it. But, lets say in a year of two they do it again like an Unus Annus II where once again they do random stuff and will be gone in a year. They do have ideas that were never fulfilled and I feel like they would use those ideas either on theyre own channels or make an Unus Annus II to use those unfulfilled ideas.
