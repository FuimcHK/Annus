I’ve been thinking about how I knew from the beginning that Unus Annus was going to end and when exactly it was going to end but for some reason I’m still to sad about it, which is why I think that Unus Annus is such a great metaphor for death and almost like practice for grief. I didn’t think I would care much about it ending since I knew it would but I do.
