Made Reddit because of Unus Annus and gonna make my first post for them too!   
I made this lock screen a few months back just because I thought it was funny and also because I wanted to remember the days we have left in a light way!   
It's genuinely nothing compared to the amazing art by the amazing people on this subreddit but just wanted to post something before it's all gone!   
Unus Annus was one of the best and will be one of my favourite channels in my life. Thank you, Ethan, Mark, Amy, Evan & the editors for absolutely everything. Best weird-ass cult, 10/10, would definitely subscribe again! (and forever :D) Love you guys! <3
