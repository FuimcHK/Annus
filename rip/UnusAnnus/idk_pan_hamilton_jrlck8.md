i was listening to hamilton the other day, and i realised something which i think is kinda cool. the song 'your obedient servant' made me think of unus annus, and if they were arguing. unus takes on the role of burr in this song, and is getting angry at annus (hamilton) for something, presumably having second thoughts about the channels end. (ignore the politics refrences  in the song though) and then unus snaps at the end of the song and shoots annus, and has his way with the channel. 

also another link i made, was the very last song, at the very end when the chorus is repeating 'who lives who dies who tells your story' imagine unus and annus slowly walking into the middle of the stage, nodding at the audience and walking to the back of the stage into the darkness. at the end when they disappear, the stage goes black and 'memento mori' projects on the screen 


thanks for listening to my ted talk
