***origenes et exitus***

*(a poem for the end)*

Beginnings and endings are fickle.

Time passes too fast for the things we love,

and too slow for the things we hate.

We deceive ourselves again and again

relishing the belief that we might be able to change,

but the turning continues

and the years pass.

Time is limiting,

we are only given so much.

In the machinations of madmen and scholars

we are but travelers of a winding road,

devoid of beginnings and endings.

But the turning takes.

We start in the beginning,

crawling through the dirt and mud,

seeking meaning and purpose;

momentary pleasures.

At the end,

waiting with open arms

lies the empty expanse,

ready to return us to the grave.

But the path continues.

But the people continue.

Travelers on weary feet,

drifting into port towns like

ships on the open sea,

each footstep a new adventure.

With each moment that passes,

the beginning grows ever distant.

With each new step,

the ones before grow muddled.

With each new person,

the path extends.

Like spiders on silk,

their paths intermingling

in the creation of a great web.

At the beginning we are told to love

and to be loved,

so we love.

Beautiful love,

the kind that rips your heart into pieces

when its inevitable conclusion comes calling.

A life is but a flower that blooms only once,

indifferent and splendid,

and the moments made become etched into petals

that blossom until they fall to ruin.

Our time together grows short,

as, again our paths must fall away.

We must go from the beginning to the ending,

there is no other possibility.

But together,

our final hours seem softer,

content in our inevitable parting.

Our sorrows no more than a passing feeling,

that might one day grow into fond remembrance.

Beginnings and endings are fickle.

Time passes too fast for the things we love,

and too slow for the things we hate.

But until our time runs out;

et invenietis gaudere

memento mori.
