I don't know if anyone's gonna read this but I have to say this before it's too late. I want to thank Mark and Ethan and I think that this is the right moment to do it. 

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for many years now. I almost never felt happy, everything was stressing me out, I couldn't sleep, I had panic attacks every day and the thing that helped me the most was watching Markiplier's videos. I've been watching him since around 2014. His videos were the only thing that could make me laugh even if I was in the middle of a mental breakdown. 

Thanks to Mark i found out about Ethan's channel. There's this one video on his channel. It's called "Please Keep Fighting | Don't Take This Risk". When Ethan stopped playing the game and started talking.... I cried. I started crying and couldn't stop. I felt like he was talking to me. I felt like finally there was somebody who cares about me. Then I decided that I'm gonna keep fighting and I'm not gonna give up.

Like a half year later Unus Annus was created. I didn't care about the time we have left, I didn't care about the clock at the end of every video. It seemed like we have so much time. Everyday I had something to wait for. I'd watch newest Unus Annus video and forget about everything bad in the world. I'd just live the moment, be happy because I'm here to see this, I'm here to be a part of it. Now.... when there's only few days left I finally realized that nothing lasts forever. The channel will be gone just like everything else in this world. And even though I still can't fully accept the truth I want to thank you for doing this. I want to thank you all. Not only Mark and Ethan but also everyone in the fanbase. I feel like I'm part of something big and that makes me happy. 

I'm gonna keep fighting and I'll never forget how much you guys helped me.
