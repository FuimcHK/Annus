It's time to say goodbye,
We've gone through this many times.
We've enjoyed our many times,
We will miss them for sure.

But we knew the time will come
When we have to say goodbye.
Goodbye, goodbye dear friend
You've brought us many happy times.

Many people knew who you were,
And many people didn't,
But those who knew
Will have you in their hearts for eternity.

One year was all it took 
To make us fall in love with you.
We wish we had you forever 
But all you had was one year.

We will miss you, we won't deny that
But it's time to say goodbye.
Goodbye, goodbye

Momento Mori











Hello! If there is someone out there that managed to find this and read this
Thank you very much and I hope you liked it! 
Mark and Ethan will probably never see this, but I wanted to post something here before the channel ended. This channel has brought me and many others so much happiness and it's sad that the channel will not exist in a few days. Again if somebody ever reads this, thank you very much and I hope you liked it!
Bye Bye!
