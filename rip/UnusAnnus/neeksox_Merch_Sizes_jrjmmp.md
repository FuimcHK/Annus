Hey, could anyone help.
I wanted to order the split logo hoodie but Im unsure what size to order, I don’t understand the sizing chart either.
I’m a 16 year old, 5’1 girl and I’m usually around a 12-14 UK size. I was generally thinking to order a M but because I’m in the uk it would be an absolute nightmare to send back if it wasn’t the right size.
