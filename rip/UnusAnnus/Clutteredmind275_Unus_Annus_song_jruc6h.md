## [Unus_Annus_song](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jruc6h/unus_annus_song/)
So I’ve been trying to make an Unus Annus song for a while but I lack the recording equipment and accidentally made it a song I can’t actually do well (but I won’t stop I will potentially upload a bad version). For context I’m a blues singer and this ended up being closer to Exit Music by Radiohead.... so yeah I’ve got quite a lot of work in a short amount of time. But it’s key Am, 96 BPM and here are the lyrics and guitar chords if anyone wants them, either to help or make their own. Hopefully if nothing else I can say I put in my all and still gave something to the community. All I ask is you credit me. 



Am Am Em Em x2


Am.     Em.    

Uuuunus Annus


Uuuunus Annus

Am

Remember death

Em

It’s coming for you

Am

Remember life 

Em

As it’s fleeting 


Am

Catch your breath

                    F                           Am

Cause one day it’ll leave you too

Am

Refute your strife

Em

Does it really matter?


Dm                G

Everyone is scared inside 

Dm                                G

Afraid one day they’ll wake up and find

Am 

There’s nothing left

Em                              Dm

Except a pasture to keep you at rest


Am                      Em

And I know it’s scary to think

Am                    Em

One day you’ll be on the brink

Am                        Dm

Breathing slows, begging for more

Am                                      Em

And there’s nothing but a tall closed door


Am              Em

Uuuuunus Annus 

Em

Memento Mori

Am             Em

Uuuuunus Annus

Am                            Dm

The clock is ticking it’s time

	     Am

To say goodbye 



Am Am Em Em x4



Am

And you cry

Am

And you think inside

    Em

It wasn’t enough time

Dm                     Am

But if you look deep inside 

            Em

you will find


C                              G

You’ll still have the memories you made 

C                           G

and the footprint that you left

F               Dm

It feels a shame 

G                                              Em

But you need now need your rest


Am

Say you piece

Em

Take your time

Am

You can’t get out 

Em                     Dm

It’s time to say goodbye 


Am              Em

Uuuuunus Annus 

Em

Memento Mori

X3

Am.   Dm.    G

Uuuuunus Annus
