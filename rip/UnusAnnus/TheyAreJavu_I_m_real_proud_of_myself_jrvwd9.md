Hello fellow Unuses and Annuses. 
Twenty four days ago, I discovered Unus Annus. One month until the end, I heard about it for the first time. I didn't start watching then, but I thought "I will in a couple of days, it's whatever.". 
Four days later, twenty days ago, twenty six days until the end, I started watching Unus Annus. And, by starting from the very fisrt video, I realized I had less then a month to watch more then 300 hundred videos. I made a playlist with every single video in chronological order, and I watched away. 
And today, I'm proud to say, I have officialy catched up. Having discovered it less then one month to the end, I will be here to watch it now, having watch every single one of these memories. 
Memento Mori, my friends. 
We'll se eachother tomorrow. Hopefully.
