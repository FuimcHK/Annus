## [Was_I_scammed_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrxr20/was_i_scammed/)
So I just ordered my unus annus hour glass youtooz and maybe I’m a bit paranoid but I wanna make sure I was on the right website and didn’t get scammed. Was it a pre-order for everyone else who ordered it as well? Like what I find funny is that there’s only three days left to order the thing but it won’t be shipped out until March 22-30... is it like that for everyone else who ordered it or was I scammed? Please let me know so I can fix this if it’s a problem...
