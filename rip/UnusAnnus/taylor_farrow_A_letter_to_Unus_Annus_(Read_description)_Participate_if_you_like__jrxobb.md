## [A_letter_to_Unus_Annus_(Read_description)_Participate_if_you_like_](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/jrxobb/a_letter_to_unus_annus_read_description/)
In our last days of the channel I want to celebrate our time together by having everyone (who wants to) write a "letter" to Unus Annus in the comments. 
You can fill the letter with whatever you want like memories, favourite moments, quotes, or even what the channel means to you. It can be vague or really personal, it'll be deleted in a couple days so you can write whatever you want.  Whether Mark and Ethan read it during the stream or not doesn't matter. What matters is how we spend these last moments together. 

Please keep it as positive as we can. Although it is sad the channel is ending, let's let our last moments be filled with celebration and positivity. There will always be time to be sad when it's gone.
