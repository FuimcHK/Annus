Hi so I had this Idea but due to some limitations I can't do it. the idea was to have a series of screenshot of the unus annus videos that show the evolution of them through the one year. seeing how ethan went from long hair to short back to long some thing like. maybe just showing the funniest moments in chronological  order. just to show how much a person can do in one Year. I hope someone will pick up this Idea
