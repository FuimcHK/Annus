One year to do it all,
A journey like none other.
Embarked upon by two young men,
They made a work of wonder.

"The sky's the limit, anything goes!"
Such was their decree;
To their word they did hold,
Even braving pee.

The year threw them a twist or two,
But they took hindrance in stride.
Nothing would stop the end of the clock,
No matter how hard one tried.

A year of laughs, joy, and fun.
Experiences shared with friends new and old.
Unus Annus will soon be done,
But the memories we shall forever hold.

We thank you Mark and Ethan both
For this wild and creative ride.
Memento Mori until the end,
From the fans you've filled with pride.
