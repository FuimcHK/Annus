I know we shouldn't download it, but I'm more and more inclined to that idea. There is one side that says i'm not ready and i want to save those videos to watch them like 3 or 5 years the future for the nostalgia and to relive the memories. But then to the end of the video there is the other side, i get sad and i know the end won't be as meaningful to me as it'd be without saving I know they wish only for the memories to remain, but i don't know if i'll be able to let go... I don't want to save them, i want to accept the fate, but i don't think i will be able to resist... how can I let go?
