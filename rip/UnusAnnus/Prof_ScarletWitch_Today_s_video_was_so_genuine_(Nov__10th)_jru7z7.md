I felt so much joy from today’s video. Like pure and genuine happiness. It was so nice seeing them return to their roots and still make it funny and new. And I’m really glad they (kinda) went through with Fuck Machine Thanksgiving, it was so beautiful 🥺 I’m sad all this is ending, but I’m over the moon that it happened. That’s the point, right? Memento Mori, everyone ❤️
