thank you for one year of fun
the end of 2019 hasn’t been a good year for me and you made me feel like i belonged somewhere, you got me through the mess of 2020 and you were alway there every single day i had something to look forward to.
thank you for helping me accept death.
and thank you for making me live in the 
i really wish we had more time but it’s only one year, that was the deal.

i will cherish every moment i had with you guys
